# about-me
i started my lab 02 , i did the html where i wrote some things from my biography , i have used css to add some style - added a background image , added a photo of me  . i used opacity on my photo and i placed it at the top center . I used order list to decribe few of my attributes and the for my skills i used ul list . #
I used Java also , where i used  the conditional statements IF and ELSE to answer some questions . Also i used the Switch expresion 
I started work on lob 03 , so i created a new list at the bottom of the page . I named my list My Top Ten Movies . I made my list an OL list .
